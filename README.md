# Package Popularity

How popular are spack packages? In this small project, we assess popularity by:

 - [commits](commits): an open source metric of popularity that gets at both updates/changes, and features or package complexity, for all of time and yearly plots.
 - [release downloads](release-downloads): GitHub release downloads give us a sense of how many people (and CI bots) are downloading the spack source code.
 - [package downloads](package-downloads): The number of downloads per package, as captured by the main spack source cache.
 - [contributors](contributors): shows us how many contributors have worked on each spack package, by totals, and years.
 - [locations](locations): create a download map by country of origin.
